	// EXPERTISE

	expertise: {
		title: "Consulting",

		speech1: `I worked for some years as a 
					technical designer for Lasbleiz Fournier Vitiello 
					in Paris, which is a workshop famous in 
					Place Vend√¥me high jewelry community for 
					its quality work. Thereafter I lived in 
					Hong Kong for another couple of years, 
					working for Michelle Ong who makes jewels 
					for the finest amateurs of this city-state.`,
		
		speech2: `Armed with the design and project management 
					skills acquired during these years, 
					I can give you precious advices to make 
					your projects happen.`
	},

	// PROTOTYPES

	prototypes: {
		title: 'Prototypes & 3D viewers',

		speech1: `Designing is never a seamless process. 
					Our task will be to work jointly to 
					reveal all the unforeseen details and 
					oversights of the original project, 
					in order to arrive at a product 
					esthetically and technically flawless 
					at the delivery date you will request.`,

		speech2: `To arrive at this perfect design and 
					to save us from discovering flaws in 
					the design late in product development, 
					we will regularly organize design reviews 
					supported by resin prototypes or 3D viewers.`
	},

	// CASTING

	casting: {
		title: 'Casting Parts',

		speech1: `Your project is designed. Now you can 
					choose lost-wax casting via 3D printing to 
					speed up your process, and ensure that the 
					finished jewel you will get is as close as possible 
					from what we designed together. 
					Armed with my jewelry handcrafting know-how, 
					particularly in the stone setting field, 
					I can adapt your design to the technical requirements 
					of 3D printing, casting, and all the subsequent stages 
					of jewelry handcrafting.`,

		speech2: `If you are not lucky enough to own a 3D printer, 
					it will be my pleasure to lead you 
					towards the right contractor.`
	},

	// DOCUMENTATION

	doc: {
		title: 'Technical Documentation',

		speech1: `Once your project is designed, 
					you are not left alone in the wild. 
					I send you all the documentation you need to 
					assemble the parts, set the stones, 
					and even communicate and advertise about it.`,

		speech2: `I adapt the documentation to every project, 
					and listen to your special demands, 
					be it parts spreadsheets, documents for public presentations 
					or customer use, outlined 4-views for painting... 
					Name your own needs.`
	},

	// WEB DEVELOPMENT

	webdev: {
		title: 'Web Development',

		speech1: `Web development has been my passion 
					for a couple of years, and I offer my 
					services in this field. My skills in jewelry, 
					3D modeling and web development is a rare 
					and precious combination if you are a 
					jewelry company with a project of high-end website.`,

		speech2: `This website was entirely designed and 
					coded by myself.`
